# Timed Quiz

## Description

This is a timed puzzle in the form of multiple-choice quiz designed to inspire existential dread.

This project was designed by applying newly acquired skills and concepts such as traversing and manipulating the DOM with JavaScript.

The puzzle functions as expected.

## Installation

Upon loading the page, click the 'START' button to start the timer countdown and view the first question. If you answer the questions incorrectly, time is deducted from the clock. You must choose the correct answer to move on to the next question. When all of the questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the game is over. If there is any time remaining on your clock, this is your final score, which can be saved to the High Score page with your initial.s
